# Office to PDF Converter

This is a simple HTTP server application written in Go that converts uploaded office files into PDF files using LibreOffice in headless mode. The server listens on port `5000` and exposes a single endpoint for file conversion. It also includes automatic cleanup of temporary files older than one hour.

## Features

- Converts various office files to PDF format using LibreOffice.
- Handles file uploads via HTTP POST requests.
- Automatic cleanup of old files from the temporary directory after one hour.
- Minimal and efficient implementation using Go.

## Requirements

- **Go**: Ensure Go is installed on your system ([Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)).
- **LibreOffice**: LibreOffice must be installed and accessible via the `soffice` command.

## Supported File Formats

This application relies on LibreOffice for file conversion, so it supports any file format LibreOffice can handle. Below are the formats that can be converted to PDF:

### Document Formats
- `.doc`, `.docx` (Microsoft Word)
- `.odt`, `.ott` (LibreOffice/OpenDocument Text)
- `.rtf` (Rich Text Format)
- `.txt` (Plain Text)

### Spreadsheet Formats
- `.xls`, `.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel)
- `.ods`, `.ots` (LibreOffice/OpenDocument Spreadsheet)
- `.csv` (Comma-Separated Values)

### Presentation Formats
- `.ppt`, `.pptx` (Microsoft PowerPoint)
- `.odp`, `.otp` (LibreOffice/OpenDocument Presentation)

### Other Formats
- `.svg` (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- `.html`, `.htm` (HTML Files)
- `.xml` (XML Files)
- `.pdf` (for PDF editing and re-exporting)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   This application does not have external dependencies, but ensure you have LibreOffice installed.

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o pdf-converter .
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./pdf-converter
   ```

The server will start listening on `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Usage

### **Endpoint: `/convert`**
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Field Name**: `file`
- **File Type**: Any supported format (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.docx`).

#### Request Example (Using `curl`):
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@example.xlsx" http://localhost:5000/convert --output output.pdf
```

#### Response:
- **Success**: Returns the converted PDF file as a response with the `Content-Type` set to `application/pdf`.
- **Error**: Returns an appropriate HTTP status code and error message if the conversion fails.

## Public Docker Image

You can use the publicly available Docker image for this application:

```bash
docker pull wteja/pdf-converter
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 wteja/pdf-converter
```

## Configuration

- Temporary files are stored in the `./tmp` directory. Ensure the application has write access to this directory.
- The application automatically removes files older than one hour from the `tmp` directory.

## Code Overview

### **Main Components**

1. **File Upload and Conversion**:
   - The `/convert` endpoint processes file uploads, saves them to the `tmp` directory, and invokes LibreOffice in headless mode to perform the conversion.

2. **Temporary Directory Management**:
   - All uploaded and converted files are stored in the `tmp` directory.
   - A background goroutine periodically checks and deletes files older than one hour.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling for file uploads, conversions, and temporary file management.

### **Key Functions**
- `handleConvert`: Handles the HTTP requests, manages file upload and conversion, and returns the resulting PDF.
- `cleanupOldFiles`: Periodically deletes old files from the `tmp` directory.

## Future Improvements

- Support additional file formats (e.g., `.pptx`, `.odg`).
- Add configurable cleanup duration and temporary directory path.
- Implement better logging and monitoring.
